# d2d frontend app

## Overview
This application shows registered vehicles locations and directions on the map.
If last location of a vehicle is inside map boundaries but its distance to d2d center ( lat: 52.53, lng: 13.403) is more than 3.5 km, those are not shown.

Application is compatible with web and mobile

## Technologies
* React 
* Mapbox
* turf
* npm

## How it works
* When the application first loaded, map is centered at ( lat: 52.53, lng: 13.403) and zoom level is 10. 
* Periodically (0.5 seconds) calls backend service regarding map boundaries in order to retrieve vehicles by location with fetch function. 
* If there are vehicles returned from service those are marked on the map with orange dots.
* If zoom level is larger than 11.4 (when the user can see roads clearly), trianles used instead of dots in order to show vehicle direction.
* If there is single location data of a vehicle it is shown as dot since there is no way of calculating vehicle direction.
* The number of vehicles inside map boundaries is shown on a panel upper left corner of screen.
